# House Prices Prediction using Deep Learning

- Developing a deep learning regression model for house price prediction involves utilizing  neural network architectures to analyze diverse features and patterns within real estate datasets. 
- Unlike classification tasks, regression focuses on predicting numerical values, making it particularly suitable for estimating property prices. 
- This advanced approach allows the model to discern complex relationships among various factors influencing house values, providing a robust tool for accurate and data-driven pricing predictions in the dynamic real estate market.
